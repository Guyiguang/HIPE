Project : Hipe



Description: The project aims to deploy dynamicaly any algorithms as NIT (Node
in tree) running on all operating system

3 steps to execute your alogorithm : 

    1)   Develop in C++ (for now) a block of algorithm and rebuild the dll
    
    2)   Send the algorithm composition to the server via Json (for now)
    
    3)  Send second request with the alorithm name and your data

News :
    - A Continuous build and tests has been deployed for the project.
