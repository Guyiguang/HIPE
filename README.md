## [1.](#Content) HIPE Hiearchic Image Processing Engine
Three watchwords into our world : TO BE A **FAST**, **SCALABLE** and **RESPONSIVE** software for **Computer Vision**...

HIPE is a standalone software as service centralazing all of ours knowledges and using several skills in ANEO like HPC/HTC, HPDA, BIG-DATA and of course Computer vision.

We are convinced that all work can be reusable in a large variety of project and can be profitable to share our knowledge for your project as well as to help team interaction within your software development.

#### 1.1 What are you talking about ?

##### The concept is to build an algorithm graph to compose your need as you wish and where the nodes represent our work, yours or external algorithm.
